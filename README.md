# scaffolder-backend-module-actions

Welcome to the Team Venture Co action repository for the Backstage `scaffolder-backend`.

This plugin contains a single action currently, but more will be added as time allows.

- `teamventureco:fetch`

## Getting started

You need to configure the actions in your backend:

## From your Backstage root directory

```sh
# From your Backstage root directory
yarn --cwd packages/backend add @team-venture-company/backstage-plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-actions
```

Configure the actions (you can check the [docs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-custom-actions/#register-action-with-new-backend-system) to see all options):

```typescript
// packages/backend/src/index.ts
const backend = createBackend();

// ...

backend.add(
  import(
    '@team-venture-company/backstage-plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-actions'
  ),
);
```

The `teamventureco:fetch` custom action leverages the built-in `fetchFile` function from the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node`
package to streamline the process of retrieving files from external sources. The `fetchFile` function supports fetching
content from a variety of URL types, including Git repositories and HTTP(S) endpoints, and seamlessly integrates with
Backstage's URL reader service. This ensures robust handling of different SCM integrations and protocols, while also
supporting authenticated requests via optional tokens. By using `fetchFile`, the action not only simplifies the
retrieval of files but also provides safety mechanisms such as secure path resolution and compatibility with
Backstageâ€™s URL reading infrastructure.

## Using the template

After loading and configuring the actions, you can use it in your template:

```yaml
# template.yaml
